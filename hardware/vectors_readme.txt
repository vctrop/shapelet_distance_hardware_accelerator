All the shapelets were extracted following the same logic. Pivot shapelets are from Wafer dataset time-series 0, while target shapelets are from Wafer time-series 0 to 4. All of them are shapelets that begin at the start of the time-series, and have multiples of 32 as lengths. All values are 32 bit hexadecimal, with lengths as unsigned and shapelet values and distances as floating point.

The distance_vector.txt content is organized as follows:
