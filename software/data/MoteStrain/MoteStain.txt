Sensor data originally from Carlos Guestrin (CMU) the subsequently used in the paper Online Latent Variable Detection in Sensor Networks and formatted for classification by Eamonn Keogh. The task is to distinguish between sensor q8calibHumid (a humidity measure) and sensor q8calibHumTemp (temperature). The data has dropouts. In the original data the dropouts have value 0. This means they are difficult to detect with normalised data.
