There are 3 different defines that change the compiled program:
USE_FIXED
    Uses a fixed point library for calculations. The default is floating point arithmetic.
    WARNING: not all functions are usable in fixed point arithmetic and the use of FLOATING POINT ARITHMETIC IS HIGHLITLY RECOMENDED!
USE_ZSCORE
    Changes the normalization function use to be z score normalization (standarization). The default is a albegric normalization (dividing each vector element by the vector norm). The use of ZSCORE NORMALIZATION IS RECOMMENDED for compliance with the original shapelets algorithm.
USE_ABS
    Changes the calculation of the euclidian distance function to use the absolute values instead of 
    calculation the power of 2. The use of this flag is experimental, and does not follow the original shapelet algorithm

The makefile contained in this repository will always build the standard shapelet extraction program:
extract_shapelets_zscore_pow : uses floating point arithmetic, z score normalization.


to make the binaries just use:
$make

The support for arm binaries was added. The variable ARMCC and ARMFLAGS
are used as compiler and required arm compilation flags, ALONG with the default CFLAGS
A test program to calculate euclidian distances can be compiled by using:
$make arm

you can install arm gcc cross compiler using:
$apt install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi
